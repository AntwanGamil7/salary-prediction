# Salary Prediction - Linear Regression (Guided Project)

This repository contains a step-by-step, guided Jupyter notebook to learn how to build a simple **Linear Regression** model that predicts salary from years of experience.

## What is included
- `Salary_project_template.ipynb` - Guided notebook (English) with `YOUR TURN` cells where you write the code and learn step-by-step.
- `requirements.txt` - Python packages used in the notebook.
- `.gitignore` - Recommended ignore file for a clean repo.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo or download files.
2. Put your CSV dataset in `data/Salary_dataset.csv` or update the path in the notebook.
3. Open `Salary_project_template.ipynb` with Jupyter or upload to Google Colab.
4. Follow the notebook sections in order and write code in `YOUR TURN` cells.

## Run on Google Colab
- Upload `Salary_dataset.csv` to Colab, then set `DATA_PATH='/content/Salary_dataset.csv'` in the notebook and run the cells.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for the main libraries. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Next steps (suggestions)
- Try RandomForest, SVR, XGBoost and compare results.
- Add cross-validation and GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning.
- Create a README with project insights and push to GitHub.

If you want, I can now:
- Add more hints inside the notebook cells.
- Convert this into a finished notebook (I can fill in code for you).
- Prepare the repo structure and GitHub instructions.

Tell me which one you want and I will prepare the files.
